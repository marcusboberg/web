00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.680
We live in a world where the 
rate of change is high,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.800
and it is very difficult to 
predict what will happen next.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.160
Therefore, there is value 
in having critical

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
infrastructure in place in Sweden,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.920
where we are not dependent on 
other countries, or their laws.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.480
Cloud infrastructure should be 
seen as critical infrastructure

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.520
and should therefore be 
present in Sweden.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.680
Hello, hello!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.960
I’m just testing this here!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560
My name is Ebba, and I work 
at Scaleout.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Scaleout operates within private AI.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.760
This means that we enable 
machine learning and artificial

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.240
intelligence in cases where 
it is inappropriate, illegal,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.360
or impossible to move the data 
that the AI model will be trained on.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.800
We use Safespring for our own 
development environment,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.560
and to provide our SaaS platform

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.920
in a secure cloud infrastructure.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.680
“This is how it will sound”.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.320
You could say that Safespring 
delivers three values to its customers.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.880
They are compliance, open standards,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.160
and digital sovereignty.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480
We help Scaleout with a few things.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.160
For them, perhaps privacy and 
compliance are the most important.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.320
With us, this is done by not 
having any third-country transfers.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.360
We integrate technical 
unctionality and align with

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.560
various articles in the GDPR to 
ensure that we have technical

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.560
functionality that meets 
regulatory requirements.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.440
And then one might ask why this 
is important right now?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.120
We see, from individuals as well 
as from regulatory authorities,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.960
an increased focus on data 
integrity and data protection.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.160
And this is one of the reasons 
why our customers prefer

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.400
us to use a Swedish cloud infrastructure.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.240
Safespring delivers scalable 
infrastructure services.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.080
So, there are collaborations both 
technically and functionally, one could say.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.280
Regarding our product development, 
we also have technical political expertise

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.360
on board, allowing us to consider 
future regulations to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.360
ensure that we help our 
customers in the future to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.960
be compliant with the local 
regulations we have here in Europe.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.600
Today, the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.760
collaboration involves running 
our own development environment

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.600
in Safespring’s cloud, and we 
continuously discuss how we can

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.640
best make

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.640
machine learning available to 
both our and Safespring’s customers.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080
For us, it is very important 
to work closely with the customer

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320
and advise, but also to 
receive feedback.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.200
It is quite rare that we 
need support

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.640
since they use open standards, 
but when needed,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.640
it is just a slack message away.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.480
In a time when all operations 
re being digitalized, we want to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.680
ensure that our customers are comfortable 
knowing they have control over their data.
