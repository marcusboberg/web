{{< /ingress >}}

## S3-API-compatible Storage Service
Safespring provides Storage-as-a-Service using object-based storage, provided by the Ceph Rados Gateway. Safespring provides the S3 API-compatible as of the Ceph versions depicted below. Exact API support level can be read on the relevant documentation page, see references below. 

### Prerequisites
None.

## Direct RADOS-integration of application
Safespring supports the direct integration of applications onto the RADOS layer, when performed and deployed by Safespring in a controlled manner. 

It is not possible for users to directly access this storage layer. The integration will be done by Safespring at professional service-based pricing, and a subsequent maintenance charge will apply. The exact pricing depends on the scope of the project and is therefore evaluated on a case by case basis.

### Prerequisites
None.
