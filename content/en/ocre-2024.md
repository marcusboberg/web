{{< ingress >}}
Safespring has been delivering reliable cloud services to the research and education sector since our launch. Empowering research and education with compute resources, container platforms, scalable storage, and flexible backup solutions is at the heart of what we do.
{{</ ingress >}}


## Why use OCRE 2024?

There are many ways that a research and education organisation can do public procurement of Safespring’s cloud services but the easiest and fastest is OCRE 2024. The reason for this is threefold:

1. The framework already has customer friendly [terms and conditions](#).
2. There is no need to do a call off from multiple cloud providers – just ask Safespring.
3. The available services and prices are public information which means that it’s easy to understand what’s available and the maximum cost.

### About OCRE
The OCRE 2024 framework is an EU-compliant cloud procurement framework, administered by GÉANT, the collaboration of European National Research and Education Networks.

The framework enables participating organisations to procure cloud services, in a compliant, easy and cost-effective way.
