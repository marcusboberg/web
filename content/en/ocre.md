### OCRE Cloud Funding for Research

On September 15, 2020, OCRE launched its first funding call for the adoption of cloud services available through the OCRE IaaS+ framework agreement. Two subsequent project calls are planned to open in February and July 2021.

In this initial cloud funding call, OCRE aims to fund the consumption of infrastructure cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, marketplace) by projects that can become clear exhibitions of the benefits of using cloud services to positively impact research outcomes.
