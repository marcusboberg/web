### OCRE Cloud Funding for Research

On 15 September 2020, OCRE launched it’s first funding call for the adoption of cloud services available through the OCRE IaaS+ framework agreements. Two subsequent calls for projects are planned to open in February and July 2021 respectively.

Under this 1st Cloud funding call, OCRE aims to fund the consumption of infrastructure-cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, marketplace) by projects which can become clear showcases for the benefits of using cloud services to positively impact research outcomes.
