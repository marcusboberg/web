### OCRE Cloud Funding for Research

On 15 September 2020, OCRE launched its first funding call to adopt cloud services available through the OCRE IaaS+ framework agreements. OCRE is planning to open two subsequent calls for projects in February and July 2021, respectively.

Under this 1st Cloud funding call, OCRE aims to fund the consumption of infrastructure-cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, marketplace) by projects that can become showcases for the benefits of using cloud services to positively impact research outcomes.
