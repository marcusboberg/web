## Cloud-based Backup Services

{{< ingress >}}
Our Backup as a Service is a true cloud-based backup service.
{{< /ingress >}}

This means that you don't need to invest in any hardware or software, all you need to do is install a client on the machines you want to back up. The fact that your data doesn't leave the country and that we are a Nordic company that is not subject to the Cloud Act, for example, means you can feel even safer.

The service is consumed over the internet and you pay for the amount of data stored in the service. The invoice for consumption will be sent monthly and the usage can be increased or decreased according to your needs. The security is very good and of course all data is encrypted both in transport (TLS over the internet) and on encrypted disks in the data center. The service is flexible and easy to use. You can individually choose which data to back up and which backup scheme to use. You have full control over your own data and your costs.

In addition to the pure backup functions, there is much other functionality, such as "Bare Machine Recovery", which makes it possible to recreate a machine in its entirety, either on another physical hardware or to a new virtual machine, for example, in our Compute environment.

### Offsite Backup Solution

If you already have a local backup solution, you can also use our Active Archive solution as a complement to store offsite backups with us. Our solution supports S3, a de facto standard for object storage, making it compatible with many backup solutions on the market. With that solution, you can significantly increase the safety of backups at a relatively low price. The installation is also easy because the connection to our Active Archive solution only needs to be configured centrally on the existing backup server and not on each machine separately.
