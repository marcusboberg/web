Your data never leaves the country and is stored on encrypted disks.

Our cloud storage is fully automated and flexible, allowing you to create new volumes with just a few easy steps. Plus, it's cost-effective, allowing you to purchase storage based on your actual needs and usage patterns rather than anticipating future requirements.

### Fast, Large, and Archive Options

**FAST**: Optimized for extremely fast storage (IOPS) using SSD hard disks, this service is ideal for transaction-intensive applications like databases.

**LARGE**: This service uses mechanical SAS hard disks with NVRAM write cache for a balance of price and performance, making it suitable for file storage and operating systems.

**ARCHIVE**: This object storage service uses SMR hard disks and offers access to an S3 interface, making it ideal for large volumes of data like e-archives or web applications for publishing.

### Other Benefits

- Invoice-based payment and role-based access for complete cost control and traceability
- Easy-to-use self-service portal
- 24/7 technical support
- Scalable to meet your business needs
- Encrypted data transmission and storage in data centers with high levels of physical security
