Looking for reliable and secure cloud-based storage? Safespring offers three different options based on the market-leading Ceph storage technology, all provided from our secure data centers in Sweden.

Your data never leaves the country and is stored on encrypted disks.

Our cloud storage is fully automated and flexible, allowing you to create new volumes with just a few easy steps. Plus, it's cost-effective, allowing you to purchase storage based on your actual needs and usage patterns rather than anticipating future requirements.

This object storage service uses SMR hard disks and offers access to an S3 interface, making it ideal for large volumes of data like e-archives or web applications for publishing.

### Other Benefits

- Invoice-based payment and role-based access for complete cost control and traceability
- Easy-to-use self-service portal
- 24/7 technical support
- Scalable to meet your business needs
- Encrypted data transmission and storage in data centers with high levels of physical security
