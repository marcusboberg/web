{{< ingress >}}
This tutorial delves into the process of launching an OpenStack instance using a volume instead of the default image source, providing a more robust data storage solution.
{{< /ingress >}}

 The video begins by explaining the benefits of using volumes, particularly their ability to store data in multiple copies, reducing the risk of data loss due to hardware failures. 

 Viewers will be guided through the steps of creating a bootable volume from an image, selecting storage types for performance or cost efficiency, and configuring the instance with appropriate network and security settings. 

 Additionally, the tutorial covers how to attach a secondary data volume to the instance, create and format a filesystem, and mount it for use. This comprehensive guide is essential for anyone looking to leverage the full capabilities of volume-based instance management in OpenStack.
