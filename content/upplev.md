### Virtual machines at your service
Safespring's cloud-based infrastructure service is based on the market-leading cloud platform OpenStack. The service is delivered from secure data centers with high availability. Data in the service never leaves the country as the data centers are located within the country's borders.

The service is flexible, fully automated, and based on self-service through a portal: users can easily start and stop new virtual machines in a few simple steps. It is also possible to control virtual machines programmatically through standardized calls to our API.

### Data centers within the country's borders
Safespring's cloud services are produced in data centers located within the country's borders and are subject to local legislation, not least the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The data centers have a very high level of physical security. All data is stored on encrypted disks. All underlying systems in the cloud platform have a high level of security hardening (SELinux). The platform is redundantly set up to achieve high availability while system components are continuously and automatically updated, based on a CI/CD environment. We call this "Secure by Design".

Safespring Compute offers great advantages such as simplified collaboration between different departments or groups, simplifies IT management, and adds efficiency and flexibility to your organization.
