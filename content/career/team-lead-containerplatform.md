{{< /ingress >}}

To plan for future expansion of our offerings, we are looking for a team lead for our new platform services team.

### About the team
The infrastructure department in Safespring is developing and operating our infrastructure based on open source infrastructure, built on a platform with Ceph and Openstack.
Within the infrastructure department, we are establishing a new platform team. The platform team will build a container platform based on OKD. As a team lead, you will be responsible for leading the team on a day to day basis, ensure that the team leads its goals and help growing the team and creating a good team culture.
Safespring was organized as a distributed organization from the beginning, and so were the infrastructure teams. That means you can choose to work from home or your home town, but if you prefer to work from an office, we currently have people working from offices in Oslo, Stockholm, and Bergen.

### Who will be the manager?
The manager for the infrastructure department is Anders Bruvik. See contact information below. He will be happy to have an informal conversation if you have questions about the position.
The team lead will work closely with our Chief Product Officer Jarle Bj√∏rgengen to define and shape our platform offering.

### About the company
Safespring is a Nordic infrastructure company delivering a locally based infrastructure as a Service based on open source software. Our Services enable customers to innovate quickly, reducing time to market and removing technical constraints while increasing efficiency and retaining data sovereignty.

From our professional data centers in Sweden and Norway, our delivery of infrastructure-as-a-Service includes Safespring Compute, Storage, and Backup. The services are flexible, fully automated, and based on self-service through API or portal. Our value proposition includes open standards, privacy, and compliance to local laws.

Our customers include some of the largest research and education organizations, government authorities, and SaaS companies in Sweden, Norway and Europe. Safespring holds directly or through a partners framework agreement with Geant (including SUNET, SIKT, NORDUnet), Kammarkollegiet, to mention the most important ones.
Safespring supports open infrastructure and open-source through memberships in open infra foundation and Gaia-X among other initiatives.

### What are you going to work on?
You will work on building and scaling up our container platform services. You will bring extensive knowledge about Kubernetes and OKD to our team. You will work with a team consisting of consultants and hired employees, and you will delegate, lead and prioritize the teams tasks on a day by day basis

### What do we expect from you?
- We expect you to communicate concisely and clearly in English.
- You have deep knowledge about continuously delivering and improving (i.e. building, operating, optimizing, monitoring, and troubleshooting) Kubernetes at scale, preferably by using the Openstack API or tooling that uses the Openstack API. Experience with Openshift or OKD is a plus.

### Previous experience with openstack and ceph is also a plus
- You have experience with Continuous Delivery, Containers, and automating infrastructure.
- You have experience with infrastructure as code - we use mostly Ansible, but experience with other tools is equally valuable.
- You have skills in at least one programming language (for instance, Python or Golang)
- You enjoy working with various people and organizations and are a good listener and communicator.

Most important: You should be willing and able to learn, grow and share. We need your knowledge to improve our customers, teams, and organization - what you learn, combined with what you already know, is our most valuable asset.
You must be a resident in a EEC country

When the platform goes into production, you will also be part of our on-call rotation, where you are responsible for out-of-hours response approximately every 6th week.

### Will there be any traveling?
We gather the team approximately every quarter, usually somewhere in Scandinavia. In addition, there is a budget for training that could either be spent at conferences and courses or on books and online courses if you prefer to travel less.

### How is the compensation?
Safespring is affiliated to Kollektivavtalet (https://www.techsverige.se) and applies to their rules in both Sweden and Norway, including local regulations for working hours, vacation, wellness benefits, and market salary.

We compensate with a combination of salary, variable salary based on the monthly targets for the company, compensation for overtime and on-call rotation. All employees have the opportunity to invest in the company.

Compensation for this position is individually negotiated.
