{{< ingress >}}
Join Safespring as a Platform Engineer and contribute to building our cutting-edge Kubernetes-based container platform. 
{{< /ingress >}}

In this role, you'll help build, operate, and refine our service, directly impacting our sustainable cloud solutions. Ideal for those passionate about open-source and collaborative innovation, you'll work closely with our tech lead, aligning with strategic goals. Safespring values a supportive, agile environmentâ€”perfect for forward-thinkers eager to shape the future of cloud technology.v

## Leadership Dynamics

- **Reporting Structure:** The Platform Engineer directly reports to the Platform Tech Lead.
- **Language Requirement:** English is the working language.

## About the position

A platform engineer in the Safespring platform team contributes to the building,
operation and continuous improvement of the Safespring container platform product.

Currently, the platform is being built with the Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Openshift (OKD). Other variants of Kubernetes may be introduced later. The platform team will build, maintain and operate the container service from scratch on top of Safespring's production IaaS.

The product is built and operated by consuming Safespring's IaaS products, OpenStack and CEPH, and the container team has the sole responsibility for upholding the service level objectives set forth by the engineering and product management.

The work should synchronize well with the product strategy of the container platform. The main synchronization point for daily work will be with the tech lead for the container platform, however, we also expect the platform engineers to exhibit a self driven mind set and actively suggest and contribute to the progress of the platform according to the overall strategy of the product and the company as whole.

Safespring is a small company, and we operate as a family where we help each other and contribute where needed most at any time. It is expected that priorities might change over time.

### Responsibilities

The platform engineer is responsible for actively progressing the customer experience of our container platform offering in coordination with the tech lead and other team members. We expect that individual contributors in the container platform team:

- Actively participate in discussions and seek help and advice to progress their own and the team's understanding of what is needed. Working in pairs will often be a preferred approach.
- Needs will be surfaced by consciously experimenting and learning from customer feedback, filtering it through our knowledge about technology, its possibilities and constraints and by measuring experiment outcomes to learn.
- Provide transparency and traceability in work- and decision processes by actively documenting intention and learning points in our work management system (JIRA) and link code changes by referencing pull requests and/or commits to work descriptions.

### Desired Expertise

We expect that the candidate has experience with at least a subset of the following aspects.

- An open-source software engineering mindset and experience working in engineering teams
- A passion for enabling users of Kubernetes to efficiently manage their containerized application lifecycle with the lowest possible effort.
- Kubernetes (K8S). Familiarity with the OKD/Openshift "distribution" of K8S is an advantage.
- CI/CD tools like ArgoCD, Flux, and secure secret handling within K8S and CI/CD context.
- K8s deployment tools like Helm, Kustomize etc
- Development and usage of Kubernetes operators.
- Ability to utilize IaaS by means of API automation only, and preferably experience with the OpenStack APIs.
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration management tools like Terraform, Ansible, Cfengine, Puppet, etc.
- General networking knowledge (IPv4/6, routing, bridging, VPN-overlays like wireguard.)
- Performance and capacity management in a containerized context.
- Monitoring and observability in a containerized context, with tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager
- Knowledge of security challenges and tooling in a container management context.
- General programming languages, preferably Python, Golang and some shell scripting

## What Safespring offer

- The opportunity to build a team that builds an attractive CI/CD experience from IaaS and up, starting from scratch.
- Be a part of the solution to deliver local and sustainable cloud services.
- Work with nice and competent people in a fast-growing small company.
- Compensation according to the market
