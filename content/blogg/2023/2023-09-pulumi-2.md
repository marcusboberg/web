In infrastructure code (and other code too) it is a good approach
to separate the program logic from it's input data (configuration). That way,
in order to change the state of our infrastructure, we only need to change the
input data and not the program unless the logic of the program changes.

{{< /ingress >}}


In the [previous blog post][pulblog1] we went through basic setup of Pulum with
the Python template for using it to manage Openstack resources in Safespring.
This a good starting point to understand the basics of how one can use Python
together with Pulumi to declaratively manage infrastructure resources without
having to write all resource graph management from the ground and up, which of
course also would be possible with Python or any modern programming language
for that matter.

One problem with the first example is that the configuration (instance name,
flavor, network and so on) is embedded alongside the Python code.

While that approach serves as a nice self contained example it quickly becomes
both error prone and tedious having to change the Python program every time a
new object (an instance for instance ;-)) should be added, changed,
reconfigured or removed.

If the configuration was stored outside the program, and loaded into it upon
execution, for example in the most ubiquitous ["human friendly data
serialization language"][yaml] in IT today: [YAML][yaml], then, that would be
an improvement over the initial approach, right ?

## Prerequisites

* [Python/Pulumi blog post number 1][pulblog1]

## Reading the instance configuration from a YAML file


Consider the following Python code:
```Python
"""An OpenStack Python Pulumi program"""

import pulumi
from pulumi_openstack import compute
from pulumi_openstack import networking
from ruamel.yaml import YAML
import os.path

# Configure the behavior for the yaml module
yaml=YAML(typ='safe')
yaml.default_flow_style = False

# Load config data from YAML file representation
# into Python dictionary representation

config_data_file = "pulumi-config.yaml"
if os.path.isfile(config_data_file):
  fh = open(config_data_file, "r")
  config_dict = yaml.load(fh)
else:
  print(f'The file {config_data_file} does not exist!')
  exit(1)


instances = {}
for instance in config_dict:
  instance = compute.Instance(instance['name'],
  name = instance['name'],
	flavor_name = instance['flavor'],
	networks = [{"name": instance['network']}],
	image_name = instance["image"])
```

In this example we have taken the same minimal set of parameters needed to
define an instance, but instead of specifying the parameters in the code we
read the from a dictionary which again is coming from de-serialising data from
the `pulumi-config.yaml` file.

And the `pulumi-config.yaml` file looks like this:

```yaml
---
- name: pulumi-snipp
  flavor: l2.c2r4.100
  image: ubuntu-22.04
  network: default
- name: pulumi-snapp
  flavor: l2.c2r4.500
  image: ubuntu-22.04
  network: public
```

So now we can just run `pulumi up` and iterate over the list of instances in
the YAML file to converge desired into state to actual state ? Well, first we
actually need to update the virtualenv the the Pulumi program uses in order to
make use of the `ruamel.yaml` module. To make sure the change persist across
when replicating the setup in other places (a pipeline for instance) we should
add the `ruamel.yaml` module to the `requirements.txt` file and then run
`venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to update the installed
Python libraries according to the requirements.

Now we can apply the desired state by:

```shell
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$ pulumi up

(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$
```

Let's inspect what was created by using openstack CLI:
```shell
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$ openstack server list |grep pulu
| 48d1cb9f-d732-4684-82e8-aa89ca05c5b9 | pulumi-snapp                          | ACTIVE  | public=212.162.147.53, 2a09:d400:0:1::2b1  | ubuntu-22.04             | l2.c2r4.500  |
| 5870d687-5aac-40b8-8f23-e54755e0fc62 | pulumi-snipp                          | ACTIVE  | default=10.68.3.95, 2a09:d400:0:2::82      | ubuntu-22.04             | l2.c2r4.100  |
(oscli) ubuntu@demo-jumphost:~/pulumi$
```

Looks like Pulumi kept it's promise.
