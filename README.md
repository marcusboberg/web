### more notes

Hugo has a feature where you can redirect old links to new ones. I used it on a personal blog earlier this year.

So for example, `Cleverlaziness.com/post/Automating%20RSS%20Feeds%20With%20IFTTT/` can redirect to `Cleverlaziness.com/2017/07/31/automating-rss-feeds-with-ifttt/`

Yeah, I can work it into the page and the design template. (edited)

So if any changes happen to the structure of the page, users can still use their old links


[18:45]
Not sure if thatâ€™s addresses your concerns.

I think that will work

Cool. The code is quite simple, too. Just add this to the blog post MD file frontmatter:
```-aliases = [
-    "/old-link/",
-    "/new-link/"```
